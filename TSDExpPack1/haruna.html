    <p><strong><em>Lore / Associated Backstory:</em></strong> Haruna Suzuki is the romantic partner and interest of The Supreme Director (A 'girlfriend'). Haruna finds apathy and hostility towards 'normal' individuals, due to an exsistential fear of [her] life being insignificant. As a little girl, Haruna would seek out the 'supernatural' in an attempt to compensate for her seemingly worthless life. One day Haruna encountered The Supreme Director, and seemingly knew from first sight that he was 'the one'. Upon further investigation she discovered just how interesting and complex The Supreme Director was, and began to pursue him. The specific actions Haruna took to secure The Supreme Director's romantic interest are unknown, and may very well have been impossible. Currently, The Supreme Director and Haruna share an intimate relationship, having participated in various 'adult activities'.</p>
