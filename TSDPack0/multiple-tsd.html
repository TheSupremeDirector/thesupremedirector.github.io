    <p><strong>Title: The Problem with Multiple The Supreme Directors</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Have you ever encountered multiple versions of The Supreme Director (TSD)? It might have seemed like there were multiple TSDs, but TSD has the ability to occupy multiple bodies at the same time as a result of his large consciousness. The real issue arises when there are multiple, different versions of TSD coexisting, which could happen through vectors such as multiversal variations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But why is this a problem? It's because differences in multiversal variation can range from trivial matters like breakfast choices to fundamental beliefs. This becomes even more problematic when you consider the immense power that TSD possesses. TSD has the ability to travel to alternate universes and even change their laws of physics. Imagine our TSD encountering another version of TSD that believes in authoritarian rule. The clash of differing perspectives and values could lead to a disastrous outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p>TSD values freedom above all else and would attempt to eliminate any alternate version that seeks to enslave organisms. But the alternate TSD would seek the same for the opposite reasons. The question arises: what happens when two beings who cannot be defeated engage in a death match? The potential damage to the fabric of reality is immeasurable, affecting all realities in all multiverses up and down their timelines. The consequences of such a disaster would be catastrophic, causing paradoxes and altering the course of history in unpredictable ways.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That's why, upon closer inspection, you'll find that there is only one true version of The Supreme Director. There are no alternate versions in any other reality. But how did TSD ensure this? The answer lies in TSD's creation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There isn't much information available, but it appears that a "proto-TSD" fought in an apocalyptic multiverse war. This proto-TSD was one of the most powerful beings of its time and viewed other versions of itself as a threat. The war ultimately destroyed everything, leaving only one version left. They became known as "the most supreme of directors", which is the origin of The Supreme Director’s name.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The most supreme of directors then went on to merge with another powerful entity to create something new: The Supreme Director. Rumor has it that this other entity was once Alexander the Great and that this is where The Supreme Director’s indomitable might comes from. The attributes of both "parents" can be seen within TSD, and this fusion had the additional side effect of making The Supreme Director “Thoroughly confused concerning his personal identity…or maybe her?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is why there is only one TSD. As a result of the war, there was only one remaining proto-TSD that could have merged to create The Supreme Director. After his creation, The Supreme Director destroyed the rotting mass of a multiverse that was left. He went on to create a new universe to take its place, full of new things and new rules, the universe seen in his legend. TSD vowed never to let such a disaster happen again and made it physically impossible for another version of himself to generate naturally. This had the unfortunate side effect of leaving TSD forever alone, with no one similar enough to understand him.</p>
