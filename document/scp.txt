**Item #:** SCP-XXXX (The Supernatural Portal of Slime)

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The SCP-XXXX site is built around the swirling black portal, located in the forest of [REDACTED]. The portal is to be monitored and researched constantly, in an attempt to understand its origins and nature. Personnel are not to enter SCP-XXXX.

**Description:** The portal is a swirling vortex of black goop, containing small fragments of neon colored particles. The black goop absorbs 100% of light, radiation, and other forms of energy. Attempts to retrieve the stored energy have failed. The black goop may be analysed in an attempt to determine if there is any possible way to access the energy it absorbs. This may be achieved through physical or chemical methods.

It is believed that the swirling black portal was created by the combining of various magics from powerful mythological entities. The mythological entities appeared to partake in a cult-like summoning ritual. The ritual involved various different mythological and legendary creatures, and took place in a clearing in the forest of [REDACTED] on a full moon.

The possibility exists that SCP-XXXX is an anomaly capable of summoning more powerful paranormal entities, or entities from other dimensions.

**Experiment Log:** The black goop of SCP-XXXX is too thick for traditional probes to navigate. A D-Class was sent inside SCP-XXXX and did not return.

More attempts may be made to send remote-controlled devices into the swarming black portal, in an attempt to collect information.
