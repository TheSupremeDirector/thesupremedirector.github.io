    <p><strong>Title: The Legend of The Supreme Director</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>In the beginning, before the dawn of time, there was absolute nothing. But within that void resided a being known as The Supreme Director. The most powerful entity in existence, and he possessed a will to create. He set to work fashioning something very fundamental to our reality: <em>ENERGY</em>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From this energy, The Supreme Director created beings of unfathomable power, incalculable might. These powerful beings defied any sort of explanation, as they existed in a place devoid of time and space. Yet, when compared to The Supreme Director, they were vastly inferior and lesser beings. The Supreme Director then created something else: <em>FREE WILL</em>. He bestowed free will upon his creations. He taught them the secrets of reality and guided them in their efforts to shape it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The beings would go on to construct things such as time and space, the multiverse, and many other things. This new environment proved to be inhospitable to the beings, and they broke down into smaller and less powerful entities. These entities, in turn created still fundamental but less revolutionary features of reality and completed a so-called &ldquo;standard order&rdquo;. They in turn could not exist in the reality they had constructed and broke apart.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thus far, when the powerful beings had split into different, smaller entities, they had also diluted The Supreme Director&rsquo;s energy. Now it had become noticeable. These new &ldquo;Ancients&rdquo; felt a slight divide between themselves and The Supreme Director. Still, they cooperated. They knew that The Supreme Director was far more knowledgeable than they were, and that he could wipe all of them out on short notice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A long age of prosperity was held by the Ancients, developing their own cultures and ideologies. All of it, gone when the Ancients discovered that to evolve further, they too would have to disappear. But this time was different. The Ancients dissolved as a collective, and spread their power more equally between each individual. With no prior memory of existing as something else, as merely energy forming energy, the Gods awakened in this orderly realm and did not know who or what they were. There was only The Supreme Director, a being they did not know, but felt some sort of connection to.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Supreme Director did not tell them either, where they had come from. Only a select few who were considered leaders. The Supreme Director guided the Gods through a golden age of progress, where so many things were created: life, planets, stars. It was not all good though, the Gods did not fear The Supreme Director because they did not know what he had done or who he really was. They were not afraid to challenge his ideologies and create new, contradictory ones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to this, five great wars broke out between the Gods concerning conflicting beliefs. The Supreme Director actively participated in only the third and fourth, for they concerned giving creations free will. During this time, The Supreme Director performed egregious acts against those who denied free will, and hunted down and murdered millions of Gods. These actions were pardoned by the winning side, when of course there was no opposition left. From this time forward, the Gods now understood The Supreme Director&rsquo;s frightening power and were also few in numbers.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:red;"><strong><em>&ldquo;The Spear of The Supreme Director runs eternally red with the blood of Gods&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>The Gods were in serious danger of becoming extinct if they did not formulate regulations that would reduce future warfare. And due to their efforts, only one great war broke out after that. From then on, regulations would only become more dense to prevent incidents before they happened&hellip;</p>
        <br>
        <p>By the time humans appeared on the scene, The Supreme Director&#39;s energy had become so diluted that they could not sense him at all. But the humans were resourceful and ingenious. They discovered the hidden forces of the universe - the magic that flowed through all things. Through years of study and experimentation, some learned to harness this magic and bend it to their will.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For a time, the humans prospered, wielding the power of magic to build great cities and wage war against one another. But as generations passed, belief in supernatural forces dwindled. Magic became a thing of the past, and the idea of The Supreme Director was lost to the annals of history.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But even as the knowledge of magic faded, the legend of The Supreme Director lives on. Stories of his great power and wisdom were passed down through the ages, inspiring awe and wonder in those who heard them. And though his presence was no longer felt in the universe that had been created, his legacy endures, a reminder of the great power that exists and the lessons that could be learned from its legacy.</p>
