    <p><strong><em>Abilities:</em></strong> The Supreme Director can inprison an entity inside of the crystal, in which it will find itself in an environment similar to space. However, the entity will not need to eat, drink, sleep, breathe, etc. While in this space, the entity will also be accelerated to its "perfect form" or highest power level. If the entity were to leave the crystal, it would have to return to the world as it was, with a taste of what it is missing out on. An illusion of The Supreme Director also appears before the entity inside the crystal, and asks it if it wants to stay forever inside as its best self. The longer the entity remains inside the crystal, the more the entity will become part of the crystal itself.</p>
