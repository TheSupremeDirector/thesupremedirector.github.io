    <p><strong><em>Abilities:</em></strong> The Supreme Director can inprison an entity inside of the crystal, in which it will find itself in an environment similar to space. However, the entity will not need to eat, drink, sleep, breathe, etc. While in this space, the entity will also be accelerated to its "perfect form" or highest power level. If the entity were to leave the crystal, it would have to return to the world as it was with a taste of what it is missing out on. An illusion of The Supreme Director also appears before the entity inside the crystal, and asks it if it wants to stay forever inside as its best self. The longer the entity remains inside the crystal, the more the entity will become part of the crystal itself.<br>While wearing the crystal, The Supreme Director can use it as a passive health boost or for regeneration. The healing power coincides with the total essence contained within it.<br>The Supreme Director can place a small bit of himself, along with his consciousness inside of the crystal in the event that he needs to extend his powers far outside of his body. Such circumstances include restructuring the entire universe, where TSD will have to spread himself along the outer edges. This method allows TSD to maintain his form and sense of self, as well as providing an easy place for the expanded energy to easily return to.</p>
