    <p><strong><em>Name:</em></strong> The Ring of The Supreme Director</p>
    <p><strong><em>Held by:</em></strong> <a href="../character/the-supreme-director.html">The Supreme Director</a></p>
    <p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> A ring that The Supreme Director wears on his left hand, ring finger. It is composed of a nickel and chromium alloy (White Lustrium) that appears sliver colored. The ring has a ruby in it. There is writing on the ring, but it is uncertain what it says. Among the writing is the year "2022", also known as the year The Supreme Director revealed himself to the public. The ring has a habit of turning gem-side down, because it is heavier. This obscures the writing on the ring.</p>
