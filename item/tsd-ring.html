    <p><strong><em>Name:</em></strong> The Ring of The Supreme Director</p>
    <p><strong><em>Held by:</em></strong> <a href="../character/the-supreme-director.html">The Supreme Director</a></p>
    <p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> A ring that The Supreme Director wears on his left hand, ring finger. It is composed of a nickel and chromium alloy (White Lustrium) that appears sliver colored. The ring has a ruby in it. There is writing on the ring, but it is uncertain what it says. Among the writing is the year "2022", also known as the year The Supreme Director revealed himself to the public. The ring has a habit of turning gem-side down, because it is heavier. This obscures the writing on the ring.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Abilities:</em></strong> The ring of The Supreme Director serves as a sort of "ID", proving that he is the one and only TSD. As long as The Supreme Director wears this ring, his powers and abilities can not be stolen. Additionally, look-alikes will not have this ring, or they will have a fake ring that does not resonate with special detection magic embedded within reality.<br>If any [other] entity attempts to remove the ring, TSD's energy will automatically make that being cease to exist, and have never existed in the first place. It is unknown how many have suffered this fate.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Dimensions:</em></strong> 10 mm tall</p>
